\subsection*{Question 4}
Consider a RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks) system where multiple hard disks are used simultaneously.\\[0.2cm]
Let's assume that we have two hard disks that work \emph{independently} of each other. Define the events $H_1 =$ ``hard disk one works'' and $H_2 =$ ``hard disk two works'' and also assume that $\Pr(H_1) = \Pr(H_2) = 0.9$.\\ \smallskip
\begin{itemize}
	\item RAID-0 is a system which increases performance but only works if \emph{both} hard disks work.
	\item RAID-1 is a system which does not increase performance but still works with only one working hard disk.
\end{itemize}

{\bf(a)} Calculate $\Pr(\text{RAID-0 works})$ and $\Pr(\text{RAID-0 fails})$. \\[0.3cm] \quad {\bf(b)} Calculate $\Pr(\text{RAID-1 works})$ and $\Pr(\text{RAID-1 fails})$. \quad {\bf(c)} Calculate $\Pr(H_1^c)$ and $\Pr(H_2^c)$. \\[0.3cm]
\quad {\bf(d)} Cheap hard disks exist with $\Pr(H) = 0.6$. Consider a RAID-1 system with 3 of these hard disks - calculate $\Pr(\text{RAID-1 fails})$ in this case. \\[0.3cm] \quad {\bf(e)} In part (a) we found that $\Pr(\text{RAID-1 fails}) = 0.01$. How many cheap disks would be required to match this level of reliability?

\section{Tutorial C - Probability}	
\subsection*{Question 1}
Assume that there are three different routes to get to a particular location: $R_1$, $R_2$ and $R_3$. You take $R_1$ 75\% of the time, $R_2$ 20\% of the time and $R_3$ the rest of the time. If you take $R_1$, there is a 90\% chance that you will be on time; if you take $R_2$, there is a 50\% chance that you will be on time and, if you take $R_3$, there is a 70\% chance that you will be on time. \\[0.1cm]
Let $T$ represent on time.\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} If $T$ represents ``on time'', what notation would we use for ``late''? \quad {\bf(b)} What is the value of $\Pr(R_1 \cap R_2)$? \quad {\bf(c)} Calculate the probability of being on time. \quad {\bf(d)} \emph{Given that} you \emph{are} on time, calculate the probabilities of having used each of the routes. \quad {\bf(e)} Given that you are late, what is the probability that you used $R_1$?









\subsection*{Question 4}
Let $X \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda=0.02)$. Calculate the following:\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} $\Pr(\,\overline{\!X} > 55)$ in a group of 100. \quad {\bf(b)} $\Pr(\,\overline{\!X} < 53)$ in a group of 40. \quad {\bf(c)} The value of $\bar x$ such that $\Pr(\,\overline{\!X} > \bar x) = 0.1$ when $n=65$. \quad {\bf(c)} The value of $n$ if $\Pr(\,\overline{\!X} < 49) = 0.1$.

\subsection*{Question 1}
You develop a random number generater which assigns a value to the random variable $X$ according to the following probability distribution:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|ccccc|}
		\hline
		&&&&&\\[-0.4cm]
		$x$ & 0.0 & 0.5 & 1.0 & 2.0 & 3.0 \\
		\hline
		&&&&&\\[-0.4cm]
		$\Pr(X=x)$ & $0.4$ & $0.2$ & $0.15$ & $0.15$ & $?$ \\[0.1cm]
		\hline
		\multicolumn{6}{c}{}\\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

{\bf(a)} What is value the value of $\Pr(X = 3.0)$? \quad {\bf(b)} Calculate $E(X)$ and $Sd(X)$. \quad {\bf(c)} You produce a gambling game where the player wins (in euro) the value of $X$ generated, e.g., if a $2.0$ appears, \euro{2} is won. How much should you charge for a play of this game so that that \emph{you} (the programmer) make a profit of \euro{0.10} on average per game? (i.e., the player \emph{loses} \euro{0.10} on average) \quad {\bf(d)} Using your answer to part (c), determine the probability that you make a profit when somebody plays this game. \quad {\bf(e)} If 10 people play this game, what is the probability that you make a profit 8 times?

\subsection*{Question 2}
You flip three coins. Let $X = $ ``the number of heads'' and $Y = $ ``the number of unique faces''.\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} What is the sample space for this experiment? \quad {\bf(b)} Construct the \emph{joint distribution} for $X$ and $Y$. \quad {\bf(c)} Based on this joint distribution, construct the \emph{marginal} distribution for $X$ and for $Y$. \quad {\bf(d)} Are $X$ and $Y$ independent? \quad {\bf(e)} Calculate $E(Y)$ and $Sd(Y)$. \quad {\bf(f)} Calculate $\Pr(Y=2\,|\,X=2)$ and interpret its value (compare with $\Pr(Y=2)$).


\subsection*{Question 3}
Let $X =$ ``the attack power of player 1'' and let $Y =$ ``the attack power of player 2''.\\[-0.3cm]

Let the probability distributions for $X$ and $Y$ be:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|ccc|c|c|ccc|}
		\cline{1-4}\cline{6-9}
		&&&&&&&&\\[-0.4cm]
		$x$ & 0 & 100 & 300 & \qquad\qquad & $y$ & 0 & 80 & 200\\
		\cline{1-4}\cline{6-9}
		&&&&&&&&\\[-0.4cm]
		$\Pr(X=x)$ & $0.2$ & $0.75$ & $0.05$ & & $\Pr(Y=y)$ & $0.1$ & $0.6$ & $0.3$ \\[0.1cm]
		\cline{1-4}\cline{6-9}
		%\multicolumn{9}{c}{}
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
{\footnotesize(e.g., p1 misses 20\% of the time, deals 100 points of damage 75\% of the time and performs a critical blow 5\% of the time.)}\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} What is the average attack power of each player? \quad {\bf(b)} If both players have 1000 hit-points, how many attacks does it take for player 1 to defeat player 2 and vice versa? Which player will win on average? \quad {\bf(c)} Let's now assume that player 1 uses his/her \emph{first} turn to cast a spell (and therefore does not attack in this turn). The result of the spell is that player 2 can no longer perform a critical blow, i.e., $\Pr(Y=200) = 0$, \emph{from turn two onwards}. Since setting $p(200) = 0$ leads to $\sum p(y) \ne 1$, assume that the remaining probability ($= 0.3$) is distributed evenly between $p(0)$ and $p(80)$. What is the outcome of the battle now?


\subsection*{Question 4}

You flip a coin 10 times - let $X =$ ``the number of heads''. Using the binomial probability function, calculate the following:\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} $\Pr(X = 2)$. \quad {\bf(b)} $\Pr(X = 0)$. \quad {\bf(c)}  $\Pr(X > 2)$. \quad {\bf(d)} $\Pr(X \le 3)$. \quad {\bf(e)} $\Pr(5 \le X \le 7)$.  \quad {\bf(f)} $E(X)$ and $Sd(X)$. \quad {\bf(g)} Using the binomial tables, calculate $\Pr(X \le10)$ in the case where the coin is flipped 20 times. \quad {\bf(h)} If the coin is flipped 50 times, what is $E(X)$?

\subsection*{Question 5}

Repeat Question 4 (a) - (e) but now using the binomial tables.
