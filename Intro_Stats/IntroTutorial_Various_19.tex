\item[(b)] \textbf{\textit{Descriptive Statistics }}\\
Consider the following data set of seven numbers:

\begin{center}
\textbf{\texttt{4, 18,  2,  7, 18,  3,  4 }}
\end{center}
% 4 Marks

\noindent For this sample, compute the following descriptive statistics:
\begin{itemize}
%
\item[a.]  The median,

\item  the mean,

\item  the median,

\item  the variance,

\item   the standard deviation.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item[(c)] \textbf{\textit{Discrete Random Variables }}\\
 The probability distribution of discrete random variable $X$ is tabulated below. There are five possible outcome of $X$, i.e. 2, 5, 10, 15 and 25.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
$x_i$ & 2 &  5 & 10 & 15 & 25  \\ \hline
$P(x_i)$ & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.15 & \mbox{ k }  & 0.10 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}

\item  Compute the value for $k$.

\item  Determine the expected value $E(X)$.

\item  Evaluate $E(X^2)$.

\item   Compute the variance of random variable $X$.
\end{itemize}
