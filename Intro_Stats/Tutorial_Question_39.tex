8. Monthly magazines are often directed at special interests of their readers, such as the countryside, wildlife, sport, motor cars. The marketing manager for one of these magazines is trying to encourage advertisers to place advertisements in her magazine. She therefore wishes to collect information on the number and types of people who read the magazine, regularly or occasionally, and their interests.

(i) Paying particular attention to the problems of constructing a sampling frame, undercoverage, non-response and likely requirements of advertisers, recommend a method
for selecting a sample from the readership. (10)

(ii) Comment on the types of information the manager should aim to collect, in addition to standard questions about name, address, age, occupation, etc. (5)

(iii) How could the frame be used, and how could the results of the exercise be kept up to date, to satisfy the likely needs of the advertisers? (5)





Q1

A multinational corporation (MNC) has two manufacturing facilities – one in Limerick, the other in Texas, both producing identical products and employing roughly the same number of ‘direct’ employees, i.e. directly involved in manufacturing.  The Operations Director randomly selected 9 weeks from the previous years production figures.  Each of the weeks chosen, employees worked 5 full days and no overtime.  The production figures for each facility is as follows (units in thousands)

(a)You are required to construct a box plot for each factory’s output and to comment on the salient features of each plot.  Is there evidence from the box plots to reject the hypothesis that there is no difference in the production figures between the two facilities?  Use the box plot to justify your comments. (8 marks)

(b)Compare and contrast the Mean and the Median as measures of location
(2 marks)

(c)Two independent resistors are located in a simple circuit as shown below.  The probability that A and B works is 0.8 and 0.7 respectively.  You are required to calculate the probability that the signal will travel from x to y.  If the two resistors were arranged in series, what difference would this make to the probability of the signal reaching y?

(c)A random sample of 100 parts (from (a) above) revealed that for 4 of those parts, the critical diameter measurements were outside spec.  You are requested to construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion defective.

If the company wished to estimate the defective rate to within + or - 2% with 99% confidence, how big a sample would need to be undertaken to provide the relevant information?

A telecommunications company has two servers from different suppliers. The Operations Director randomly selected 9 months from the previous year’s figures.  The down time figures for each server is as follows (down time per month in hours)

(c)Two independent resistors are located in a simple circuit as shown below.  You are required to calculate the probability that the signal will travel from x to y.  Resistor A has a mean time of 20 hours to failure and Resistor B a mean time of 40 hours.  Assume that the respective failure rates follow an exponential distribution.  What is the probability that signal integrity will be maintained between x and y for 30 or more hours?
