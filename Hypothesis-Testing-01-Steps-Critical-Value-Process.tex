\noindent \textbf{Standard Errors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Standard Error Formula are typically provided in the exam paper, or an accompanying document.
    \item Each type of test has a different Standard Error Formula.
\end{itemize}
\bigslip

\noindent \textbf{General Structure of the Test Statistic}
\begin{framed}
\[ TS = {\mbox{Point Estimate} - \mbox{Expected Parameter Value under $H_{0}$} \over \mbox{Std. Error}}\]
\end{framed}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage 
\subsection*{Determine the Critical Value}

\begin{itemize}
\item The critical value is determined from Statistical Tables.
\item Determination depends on the significance level $\alpha$, the sample size $n$ and the number of tails in the test (i.e. is it a one-tailed or two tailed test.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Significance Level}

\begin{itemize}
\item In hypothesis testing, the significance level $\alpha$ is the criterion used for rejecting the null hypothesis. 
%\item The significance level of a statistical hypothesis test is a fixed probability of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$, if it is in fact true.
%\item Equivalently, the significance level (denoted by $\alpha$) is the probability that the test statistics will fall into the \textbf{\emph{critical region}}, when the null hypothesis is actually true. 

\item In University courses, common choices for $\alpha$ are $0.05$ and $0.01$. We will use $\alpha =0.05$ (i.e. 5\%).

	\item 	If $TS > CV$ , where $CV$ is a critical value corresponding to the sample size and confidence level, then reject the null hypothesis.
