A motor dealership which specializes in agricultural machinery sells one vehicle every 2 days, on average. Answer the following questions.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item  What is the probability that the dealership sells at least one vehicle in one particular day?
    \item  What is the probability that the dealership will sell exactly one vehicle in one particular day?
    \item  What is the probability that the dealership will sell 4 vehicles or more in a six day working week?
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Expected Occurrences per Day: m = 0.5
    \item Probability that the dealership sells at least one vehicle in one particular day?
    \[ P(X \geq 1) = 0.3935 \]
    \item Probability that the dealership will sell exactly one vehicle in one particular day?
    \[ P(X = 1) = P(X \geq 1) - P(X \geq 2)  = 0.3935 - 0.0902 = 0.3031\]
    \item Probability that the dealership will sell 4 vehicles or more in a six day working week?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item For a 6 day week, m=3
    \item $P(X \geq 4) = 0.3528$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
