Assume that the diameter of a critical component is normally distributed with a Mean of 50mm and a Standard Deviation of 2mm.

NB 	You must draw a rough sketch of the normal curve and estimate the approximate probability of the following measurements occurring on an individual component.
\begin{itemize}
\item Between 50 and 51.2mm
\item Less than 48.5 mm
\item Between 48.2 and 51.2 mm
\end{itemize}

Use the normal tables to get the exact probabilities for the above.

\item[(d)] \textbf{\textit{Poisson Approximation of the Binomial Distribution (3 Marks)}}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Describe how the Poisson distribution can be used to approximate the binomial distribution.
\item  Explain the circumstances in which this approximation may be used in preference to the binomial distribution.
\end{itemize}
