\subsection*{Question 1}
A sample of individuals were randomly assigned one of two diet plans. Over a 6-week period these individuals followed their assigned plan. Their weight loss was recorded at the end of the 6-week period and the results were as follows: \\[-0.2cm]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
&&\\[-0.4cm]
& Plan 1 & Plan 2 \\
\hline
&&\\[-0.4cm]
sample size & 42 & 50 \\
mean weight loss & 7.1\,\,\,lbs & 5.2\,\,\,lbs \\
variance & 10.1\,\,\,lbs$^2$ & 16.1\,\,\,lbs$^2$ \\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{c}{}\\[-0.3cm]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We wish to test the hypothesis that there is no difference between diet plans.\\[0.2cm]
{\bf(a)} State the null and alternative hypotheses. \quad {\bf(b)} Calculate the test statistic. \quad \\{\bf(c)} Calculate the p-value. \quad {\bf(d)} What is your conclusion?
