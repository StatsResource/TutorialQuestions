\item 


Six athletes run 400 metres both at sea level and 1000m above sea level. The times they take are given below. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
Runner & 1&2 & 3& 4& 5&  6\\ \hline
Time at sea level&45.8&47.1&45.4&46.1 & 48.4& 44.9\\ \hline
Time at altitude&44.8&45.1&45.4&45.1 &45.4& 45.9\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Is there any evidence that their speed depends on altitude? 
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the mean difference between the time at sea level and the time at altitude. Using this confidence interval, test the null hypothesis that the average time at altitude is 3 seconds faster than the average time at sea level (state the appropriate significance level).
\item What assumption is used in both parts a) and b)? 
\end{enumerate}

\item 
 A researcher was investigating computer usage among students at a particular university. 
 Three hundred undergraduates and one hundred postgraduates were chosen at random and asked if they owned a laptop. It was found that 150 of the undergraduates and 80 of the postgraduates owned a laptop. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)]  Find a 95\% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of undergraduates and postgraduates who own a laptop. 
    \item[(b)] On the basis of this interval, do you believe that postgraduates and undergraduates are equally likely to own a laptop? 
\end{itemize}
