\item 
In a computer hardware manufacturing plant, machine X and machine Y
produce identical components. The management investigate whether or
not there is a difference in the mean diameter of the components from
both machines.
\begin{itemize}
\item A random sample of 144 components from machine X had a mean of
36.38 mm and a standard deviation of 3.0 mm.
\item  A random sample of 225 components from machine Y had a mean of
36.88 mm and a standard deviation of 2.8 mm.
\end{itemize}
A hypothesis test was used to determine whether or not the means are
significantly different. A 5\% significance level was used.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What is the null and alternative hypothesis?
\item Compute the test statistic.
\item What is your conclusion for this procedure? Justify your
answer.
\end{enumerate}

\item Two similar machines are making components of a particular length
in mm. Give a $95\%$ confidence interval for the difference in average length between
the components produced by the two machines. Assume that the populations are normal
with variance 9 for the first machine and 16 for the second machine.
\begin{itemize}
\item The results for each machine are\\ \bigskip
\textbf{Machine A:} $\{ 23.7, 23.0, 22.2, 24.0, 21.2, 23.1, 27.1, 24.0 \}   $ ($n_1= 8$)\\ \bigskip
\textbf{Machine B:} $\{23.4, 15.3, 30.9, 18.8, 25.3, 25.2, 32.1\}$  ($n_2=7$) \\
\end{itemize}
