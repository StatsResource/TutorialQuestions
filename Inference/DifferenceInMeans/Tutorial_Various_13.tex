\item[(c)]  \textbf{\textit{Hypothesis Testing (9 Marks)}}\\
In a computer hardware manufacturing plant, machine X and machine Y produce identical components. The management investigate whether or not there is a difference in the mean diameter of the components from both machines.

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] A random sample of 144 components from machine X had a mean of 36.38 mm and a standard deviation of 3.0 mm.
\item[$\bullet$] A random sample of 225 components from machine Y had a mean of 36.88 mm and a standard deviation of 2.8 mm.
\end{itemize}
A hypothesis test was used to determine whether or not the means are significantly different.
A $5\%$ significance level was used.

\begin{itemize}
\item  What is the null and alternative hypothesis?
\item  Compute the test statistic.
\item  What is your conclusion for this procedure? Justify your answer.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
