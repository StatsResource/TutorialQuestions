Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the mean number of marks obtained by males and females in the population of school leavers as a whole.
%(7 marks)

Test the hypothesis that males and females on average obtain the same mark in the biology leaving certificate exam. Use a significance level of $5\%$. You may assume that all required assumptions have been validated.\\% State your hypotheses clearly. What is the significance level of this test?
