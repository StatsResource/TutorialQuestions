\subsection{Example 2}

Seven measurements of the pH of a buffer solution gave the
following results:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		5.12 & 5.20 & 5.15 & 5.17 & 5.16 & 5.19 & 5.15\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}


Task 1: Calculate the 95\% confidence limits for the true pH
utilizing $R$.


Solution. We are using Student t distribution with six degrees of
freedom and the following code gives us the confidence interval
for this problem.
%%		\begin{verbatim}
%%		>x <- c(5.12, 5.20, 5.15, 5.17, 5.16, 5.19, 5.15)
%%		>n =length(x)
%%		>alpha =0.05
%%		>stderr =sd(x)/sqrt(n)
%%		>LB=mean(x)+qt(alpha/2,6)* stderr
%%		>UB=mean(x)+qt(1-alpha/2,6)* stderr
%%		>LB
%%		#[1] 5.137975
%%		>UB
%%		#[1]5.187739
%%		\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Example 3} Ten replicate analyses of the concentration
of mercury in a sample of commercial gas condensate gave the
following results (in ng/ml) :

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		23.3 & 22.5 & 21.9 & 21.5 & 19.9 & 21.3 & 21.7 & 23.8 & 22.6 &
		24.7\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Compute 99\% confidence limits for the mean.

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Worked Example}
	Calculate a 99\% confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of all Irish having access to the
	Internet and the proportion of all Spaniards having access to the internet.  (4 marks)
	
	
	
	\noindent \textbf{Standard Error for confidence interval}	
	
	\[\frac{p1(1 -p1)}{n1}+ \frac{p2(1 -p2)}{n2}\]

		\item 	A survey was carried out to investigate absenteeism in the building industry.
		\item Data on the number of sick days per year and type of job (unskilled or skilled)
		were collected for a random sample of employees.
		\item The mean number of sick days for 50 unskilled workers was 3.8 days with a standard deviation of 2.6 days. 
		\item The mean number of sick days for 60 skilled workers was 3 days with a standard deviation of 2.2 days. 
		\item (Hint: This is a test of whether that the means of the two groups are the same)
		
		\item Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.

\subsection{Small Sample Test For Means - Worked Example}
%	D Hypothesis Testing - Example
The catering manager in a hotel suspects that the weight of loaves of bread delivered
daily by a bakery is consistently below the nominal weight of 800g. To test this,
10 loaves chosen at random from a dayâ€™s deliveries are weighed. The mean and
standard deviation of the ten weights are 792g and 25g, respectively.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Carry out a formal significance test.
	\item List the steps involved in this test 
	\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the average weight of loaves produced
	\item Comment on the correspondence between the interval, as calculated, and the
	result of the test.
\end{enumerate}	



%		\noindent \textbf{Solution 2}
%		
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Confidence interval width is 3, so half-width is 1.5
%			
%			\item Seek n such that $1.96 \times \frac{9}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.5$
%			
%			\item Divide both sides by $1.96 \times 9$ \\
%			\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.5}{1.96 \times 9} =\]
%			
%			
%			\item invert and square boths sides.
