A random sample of 100 resistors revealed that 5 were outside specification.  

You are requested to construct a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of resistors that are defective (outside specification).
 
If the company wished to estimate the defective rate to within + or - 2\% with 99\% confidence, how big a sample would need to be undertaken to provide the relevant information?
