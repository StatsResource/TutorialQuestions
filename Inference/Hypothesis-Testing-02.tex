 A sample of 50 households in one community
 shows that 10 of them are watching a TV special on the national

\item 
 The mean height of adult males is 69 inches and the standard
 deviation is 2.5 inches. The mean height of adult females is 65
 inches and the standard deviation is 2.5 inches. Let population 1
 be the population of male heights, and population 2 the population
 of female heights. Suppose samples of 50 each are selected from
 both populations.
