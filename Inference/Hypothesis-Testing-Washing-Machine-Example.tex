\subsection{Wasking Machine Example}%example: 
Suppose a machine produces circular parts for an electrical component. A random sample of 10 circular parts is selected and the variance of the sample is found to be 0.7 centimetres. The machine is producing the correct standard of circular parts if the variance of the diameter is no larger than 0.4cm.

Suppose that the sampled measurements are normally distributed. A hypothesis test may be carried out to determine whether or not the machine is producing the correct standard of part.

\begin{description}
\item[$H_0$] $s^2=0.4$
\item[$H_1$] $s^2>0.4$
\end{description} 

\begin{itemize}
\item At a 5\% significance level, the critical value for the test is ? 2 9 ˜ 16.92 . 
\item The test statistic is ? 2 = n - 1 s 2 s 2 
\item H 0 = 10 - 1 × 0.7 0.4 = 15.75 .
\end{itemize}




As the test statistic is less than the critical value, there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The machine is therefore producing a sufficient standard of circular parts.
