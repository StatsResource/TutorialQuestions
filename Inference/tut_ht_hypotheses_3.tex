\section*{Hypothesis Testing : Tutorial Sheet C}
\begin{enumerate}

\item 
An IT competency test, used for staff recruitment, is devised so as to give a normal distribution of scores with a mean of 100. 
A random sample of 49 experienced IT users  who are given the test achieve a mean score of 121 with a standard deviation of 14. 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item	Perform a hypothesis test to assess whether this group of IT Users is unusual (i.e. have a different mean from the general population).
\item	Compute a 95\% confidence interval for the group.
\end{enumerate}

\item  
A claim has been made that the mean body temperature of healthy adults is equal to 98.6 degrees. 
A sample of 106 people has produced a mean body temperature of 98.2 degrees and a standard deviation of 0.62. Test the claim using a 5\% significance.

\item 
A manufacturer of computer monitors  has for many years used a process giving a mean life of 4700 hours and a standard deviation of 1460 hours. 
A new process is tried to see if it will increase the life significantly. A sample of 100 monitors gave a mean life of 5000 hours.  
Does the new process make a difference at the 5\% level of significance?

\item In a study of store checkout scanners, 1234 items were checked and 20 of them were overcharges.
Use a 5\% significance level to test the claim that with scanners, 1\% of sales are overcharges.
