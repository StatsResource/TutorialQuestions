In a computer hardware manufacturing plant, machine X and machine Y
produce identical components. The management investigate whether or
not there is a difference in the mean diameter of the components from
both machines.
\begin{itemize}
\item A random sample of 144 components from machine X had a mean of
36.38 mm and a standard deviation of 3.0 mm.
\item  A random sample of 225 components from machine Y had a mean of
36.88 mm and a standard deviation of 2.8 mm.
\end{itemize}
Compute a 95\% confidence interval for the difference in means.What is your conclusion for this procedure? Justify your
answer.
\item Two similar machines are making components of a particular length in mm.
Compute a 95\% confidence interval for the difference in average length between the components

The results for each machine are
\begin{itemize}
\item Machine A: $\{23.7, 23.0, 22.2, 24.0, 21.2, 23.1, 27.1, 24.0\}$ $(n_1 = 8)$
\item Machine B: $\{23.4, 15.3, 30.9, 18.8, 25.3, 25.2, 32.1\}$ ($n_2 = 7)$
\end{itemize}

You may assume that the populations are normal with variance 9 for the first machine and 16 for
the second machine.
