\begin{enumerate}
\item There are 200 students on course A and another 200 students on course B.  On the final exam, the 200 students on course A scored a mean mark of 68 with a standard deviation of 20, while those on course B obtained a mean mark of 73 with a standard deviation of 18.
	(Hint: This is a test of whether that the means of the two groups are the same)
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
		\item[(ii)] Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?
	\end{itemize}
	
\item A Health and Safety survey of 200 industrial accidents revealed that 53
were due to untidy working conditions.

A factory manager claims that the above sample is just a one off, and that less than 20\% of accidents are a result of untidy working conditions.

(Hint: This is a test of whether the nominal proportion is too low.)
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
	\item[(ii)] Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?
\end{itemize}

\item A survey was carried out to investigate absenteeism in the building industry.
Data on the number of sick days per year and type of job (unskilled or skilled)
were collected for a random sample of employees.
\begin{itemize} 	
	\item The mean number of sick days for 50 unskilled workers was 3.8 days with a standard deviation of 2.6 days.
	\item The mean number of sick days for 60 skilled workers was 3 days with a standard deviation of 2.2 days.

\end{itemize}	
(Hint: This is a test of whether that the means of the two groups are the same)

	\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
	\item[(ii)] Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?
\end{itemize}

\item 
A coal-fired power plant is considering two different systems for pollution abatement. The first system has reduced the emission of pollutants to acceptable levels 68\% of the time, as determined from 200 air samples. The second, more expensive system has reduced the emission of
pollutants to acceptable levels 70\% of the time, as determined from 250 air samples. lf the expensive system is significantly more eilective than the inexpensive system in reducing the pollutants to acceptable levels, then the management of the power plant will install the expensive system.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
	\item[(ii)] Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?

%	Question 3.1 (c) \\
Based on birth records for millions of babies, the percentage of newborn babies in Sweden that are female is 51\%. A group of researchers in Sweden are interested in finding out if women who suffer from severe morning
sickness are more likely to have a girl.

The researchers looked at records for 1000 women admitted to hospital for
severe morning sickness and determined that 560 of these women gave birth
to a female baby.  [Source: Lancet 354: 2053, 1999].
(Hint: This is a test of whether the nominal proportion is too low)
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
	\item[(ii)] Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?
\end{itemize}

\item 
	%%Question 3.1 (g)\\
	A firm that produces lightbulbs claim that their products last on average 1000 hours. An independent study took a random sample of 150 lightbulbs, and found the average burning time to be 990 (with a standard deviation of 60)
	
	\textit{(Hint: This is a test of whether the nominal mean is too high)}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
		\item[(ii)] Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?
	\end{itemize}
\item A study was carried out in which researchers collected crime data. Of those convicted of
arson, 50 were drinkers and 43 abstained. Of those convicted of fraud, 63 were drinkers and 144
abstained. Use a 0.05 level of significance to test the claim that the proportion of drinkers among
convicted arsonists is greater than the proportion of drinkers convicted of fraud.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.
	\item[(ii)] Is this a One Tail or Two Tail test?
\end{itemize}

\item 
In the past, 18\% of shoppers have bought a particular brand of breakfast cereal.
After an advertising campaign, a random sample of 220 shoppers is taken and 55 of the sample have bought this brand of cereal.

Write down the null and the alternative hypothesis for this problem, and state whether it is a one tailed or two tailed test

\item The conventional treatment for a disease has been shown to be effective in
80\% of all cases. A new drug is being promoted by a pharmaceutical
company; the Department of Health wishes to test whether the new treatment
is more effective than the conventional treatment.

Write down the null and the alternative hypothesis for this problem, and state whether it is a one tailed or two tailed test
