\section*{Question 4 Poisson Distribution []}

\begin{itemize}

\item Suppose that, for a Poisson random variables $X$, the expected number of occurences in a one hour time period is 2. 



\item Furthermore, the probability of exactly one occurence in a one
 hour time period is $0.2706$.


\item Based on this information, answer the following questions.
\end{itemize}
\noindent{\textbf{Questions}}
\begin{itemize}

\item[(a)]  Compute the probability of no occurences in a one hour period?

\item[(b)]  What is the probability of two or more occurences in a one hour period?

\item[(c)]  Suppose $Y$ is a random variable that describes the amount of time between occurences. What probability distribution should be used to describe $Y$?
