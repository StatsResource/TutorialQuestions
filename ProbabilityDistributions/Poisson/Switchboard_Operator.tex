(c)Telephone calls coming in to a busy switchboard follow a Poisson distribution with 3 calls expected in a one minute period.  
The switchboard operator can answer at most 3 calls in a one minute period; the fourth and succeeding calls receive a busy signal.

(i)   Find the probability of receiving a busy signal.
(ii)   The switchboard operator leaves the switchboard unattended for 2 minutes.  What is the probability that exactly 1 call will be missed during that 2 minute period?
(6 marks)

(d)In what circumstances can the Poisson distribution be used to approximate the Binomial distribution?
(2 marks)
