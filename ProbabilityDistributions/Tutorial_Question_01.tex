\subsection*{Question 3}
Let $X =$ ``the attack power of player 1'' and let $Y =$ ``the attack power of player 2''.\\[-0.3cm]

Let the probability distributions for $X$ and $Y$ be:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|ccc|c|c|ccc|}
		\cline{1-4}\cline{6-9}
		&&&&&&&&\\[-0.4cm]
		$x$ & 0 & 100 & 300 & \qquad\qquad & $y$ & 0 & 80 & 200\\
		\cline{1-4}\cline{6-9}
		&&&&&&&&\\[-0.4cm]
		$\Pr(X=x)$ & $0.2$ & $0.75$ & $0.05$ & & $\Pr(Y=y)$ & $0.1$ & $0.6$ & $0.3$ \\[0.1cm]
		\cline{1-4}\cline{6-9}
		%\multicolumn{9}{c}{}
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
{\footnotesize(e.g., p1 misses 20\% of the time, deals 100 points of damage 75\% of the time and performs a critical blow 5\% of the time.)}\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} What is the average attack power of each player? 
 \item  If both players have 1000 hit-points, how many attacks does it take for player 1 to defeat player 2 and vice versa? Which player will win on average? 
 \item  Let's now assume that player 1 uses his/her \emph{first} turn to cast a spell (and therefore does not attack in this turn). The result of the spell is that player 2 can no longer perform a critical blow, i.e., $\Pr(Y=200) = 0$, \emph{from turn two onwards}. Since setting $p(200) = 0$ leads to $\sum p(y) \ne 1$, assume that the remaining probability ($= 0.3$) is distributed evenly between $p(0)$ and $p(80)$. What is the outcome of the battle now?


\subsection*{Question 4}

You flip a coin 10 times - let $X =$ ``the number of heads''. Using the binomial probability function, calculate the following:\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} $\Pr(X = 2)$. 
 \item  $\Pr(X = 0)$. 
 \item   $\Pr(X > 2)$. 
 \item  $\Pr(X \le 3)$. 
 \item  $\Pr(5 \le X \le 7)$.  
 \item  $E(X)$ and $Sd(X)$. 
 \item {\bf(g)} Using the binomial tables, calculate $\Pr(X \le10)$ in the case where the coin is flipped 20 times. 
 \item {\bf(h)} If the coin is flipped 50 times, what is $E(X)$?

\subsection*{Question 5}

Repeat Question 4 (a) - (e) but now using the binomial tables.
