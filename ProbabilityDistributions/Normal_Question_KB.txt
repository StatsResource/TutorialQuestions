\subsection*{Question 1}
Assume that a character in a game is programmed to have an attack power according to $X \sim \text{Normal}(\mu=40,\sigma=3)$.\\[-0.2cm]

\item  What is the probability that the attack is greater than 45? 
 \item  What is the probability that the attack is between 32 and 42? 
 \item  Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the first and second attacks. What is the probability that the \emph{sum} of these two attacks is greater than 85 units? 
 \\{\bf(d)} Calculate 99\% limits for the sum of two attacks.  
 {\bf(e)} What is the probability that the \emph{difference} in attacks is more than 5 units? Note that attack 2 can be 5 units more than attack 1 or attack 1 can be 5 units more than attack 2, i.e., $\Pr(|D|>5)=\Pr(D<-5) + \Pr(D>5)$.



\subsection*{Question 2}

A character in a game deals a standard attack 75\% of the time and a critical attack the rest of the time (call these events $S$ and $S^c$). Given that it is a standard attack, the attack power is $X\,|\,S \sim \text{Normal}(\mu=40,\sigma=3)$. When the character deals a critical attack, a random fluctuation is added to this according to a $\text{Normal}(\mu=5,\sigma=1)$ distribution.\\[-0.2cm]

\item  What is the distribution of $X\,|\,S^c$? 
 \item  Calculate $\Pr(X<43\,|\,S)$ and $\Pr(X<43\,|\,S^c)$. 
 \item  Calculate $\Pr(X<43)$. \,\, (hint: law of total probability) 
 \item  If the character deals less than 43 damage points, what is the probability that the attack was a critical attack?
