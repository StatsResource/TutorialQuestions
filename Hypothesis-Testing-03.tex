 cards. The board of directors voted to institute an expensive monitoring system if the mean for all the banks customers is greater than 2000.
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item The bank randomly selected 50 credit-card holders and
 	determined the amounts they charged. 
 	\item For this sample group, the mean is 2177and the standard	deviation is  1257. 
 \end{itemize}
  Using a 0.05 level of significance, test the claim that the mean amount charged
 is greater than 2000. Will the monitoring system be implemented?
