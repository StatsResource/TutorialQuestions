\item Mean blood iron concentration for children with adequate nutrition is taken to be 110mg/dl. \\ 25 randomly selected children from a disadvantaged urban area were given blood tests. The mean concentration of iron from this sample was 98 mg/dl with a standard deviation of 25.5 mg/dl.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] (4 Marks) Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the mean concentration of iron for children in this area. 
	\item[(b)](2 Marks) Interpret this confidence interval.  Do these results provide evidence that children in this area suffer from iron deficiency? 
\end{itemize}
\medskip
Test this hypothesis using a 5\% level of significance. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(c)](3 Marks) Formally state your null and alternative hypotheses.
	\item[(d)](4 Marks) Compute the test statistic.
	\item[(e)](2 Marks) Discuss your conclusion to this test, supporting your statement with reference to appropriate values.
