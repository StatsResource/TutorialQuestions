\begin{itemize}
	\item In this procedure, we determine whether or not two \textit{\textbf{populations}} have the same variance.
	\item The assumption of equal variance of two populations underpins several inference procedures. This assumption is tested by comparing the variance of samples taken from both populations.
	\item The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:
	\[ H_0: \sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2 \]
	\[ H_1: \sigma^2_1 \neq \sigma^2_2 \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Test 3. Shapiro Wilk's Test for Normality}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We will often be required to determine whether or not a data set is normally distributed.
	This assumption underpins many statistical models.
	\item The null hypothesis is that the data set is normally distributed.
	\item The alternative hypothesis is that the data set is not normally distributed.
	\item One procedure for testing these hypotheses is the Shapiro-Wilk test, implemented in \texttt{R} using the command \texttt{shapiro.test()}.
