\subsection*{Question 6 Exponential Distrbution [2 Marks]}
% Exponential [3 Marks]

Suppose an exponential random variable $X$ describes a ``lifetime" denominated in days, has a rate parameter of $\lambda = 1/7$
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  What is the probability of a lifetime less than 5 days?
\item[(b)]  What is the probability of lifetime greater than 7 days?
\end{itemize}


\noindent(When answering, justify your answer with workings, or by reference to an
axiom, theorem or rule.)
