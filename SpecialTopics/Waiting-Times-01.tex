\subsection*{Question 5}
The \emph{average time} between customers arriving to a shop is 5 minutes. We will assume that the time, $T$, has an exponential distribution. Calculate the following:\\[-0.2cm]
\begin{itemize}

 \item[(a)] The average arrival \emph{rate}, i.e., $\lambda$ customers per minute.  
 \item[(b)] The probability that we wait more than 15 minutes for the next customer.  
 \item[(c)] The probability that the next customer arrives within 1 minute.  
 \item[(d)] The average \emph{number of customers} in a 1 hour period. What is the standard deviation that goes with this average?  
 \item[(e)] The probability that \emph{15 or more} customers arrive in a 1 hour period.
\end{itemize}
