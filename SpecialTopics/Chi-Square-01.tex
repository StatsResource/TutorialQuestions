\subsection*{Question 7}
One hundred computer science graduates from each of three different universities were asked how many programming languages they are competent in. The results were as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|cc|cccc|c|}
\hline
&&&&&&\\[-0.3cm]
&& \multicolumn{4}{c|}{Languages} & $\sum$ \\
                    && 1 & 2 & 3 & 4+ & \\[0.1cm]

{\bf(a)} Calculate the expected frequencies assuming independence of the two variables. \quad \\{\bf(b)} Calculate the $\chi^2$ statistic and, hence, a range within which the p-value lies. \quad \\ {\bf(c)} What is your conclusion? \quad {\bf(d)} Calculate the raw difference scores ($o_i - e_i$) and comment.
