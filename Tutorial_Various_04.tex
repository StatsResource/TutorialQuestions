
\item[(d)] \textbf{\textit{Inference Procedures with \texttt{R} (6 Marks)}}\\
The standard deviations of data sets \texttt{X} and \texttt{Y} are 10 and 9 respectively. 
An inference procedure was carried out to assess whether or not \texttt{X} and \texttt{Y} can be assumed to have equal variance.
\begin{itemize}
\item[i.](2 Mark) Formally state the null and alternative hypothesis.
\item[ii.](1 Mark) The Test Statistic has been omitted from the computer code output. Compute the value of the Test Statistic.
\item[iii.](2 Marks) What is your conclusion for this procedure? Justify your answer.
\item[iv.] (1 Marks) Explain how a conclusion for this procedure can be based on the $95\%$ confidence interval.
\end{itemize}
