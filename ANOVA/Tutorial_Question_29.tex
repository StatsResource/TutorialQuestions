Q5
A manufacturing technology engineer wanted to establish if there was a relationship between the pull strength of injection moulded parts and the dwell time in the mould. A random sample of 7 different times and their corresponding pounds per square inch were recorded as follows:
X	Y
Time (in hours)	Pull Strength
1	2.8	7.8
2	2.9	8.1
3	3.1	8
4	3.3	8.4
5	3.7	8.6
6	3.9	8.8
7	4.1	9
%% \sumxy =	200.89	 \sumx2 = 	82.46	 \sumx = 23.8	\sumy = 58.7
(a) 	You are required to 
i.	Draw a scattergram and comment on its features
ii.	Find the regression equation and plot the regression equation on scattergram
(8 marks)
The data was entered into Minitab and the following outputs were generated
Predictor	Coef		SE Coef	T		P
Constant			0.2880		19.07		0.000
Hours				0.08391	10.14		0.000
S= 0.1041	R-Sq = 95.4%		R-Sq(adj) = 94.4%
(b) 	You are requested to explain how the T-value of 10.14 was calculated and to 
interpret the corresponding P value of 0.000
(4 marks)
PTO
(c)	Fill in the blanks from the following tables and explain the relationship between F value of 102.76 and the T-value of 10.14 in section (b)
