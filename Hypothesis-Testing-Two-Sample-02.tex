\item 
A survey, carried out at a major flower and gardening show, was concerned with the association between the intention to return to the show next year and the purchase of goods at this year's show.
\begin{itemize}
	\item There were 220 people interviewed and of these 101 had made a purchase; 69 of these people said they intended to return next year. 
	\item Of the 119 who had not made a purchase, 68 said they intended to return next year.
\end{itemize}
By testing the difference between the proportions of purchasers and non-purchasers who intend to return next year, examine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify concluding that the intention to return depends on whether or not a purchase was made.
