\section{Question D01  - Poisson Example}
A motor dealership which specializes in agricultural machinery sells on vehicle every 2 days, on average

In this question the unit period is one day. The company expects to sell, on average, 0.5 vehicles every day.
The Poisson mean $m$ is therefore 0.5.

$P(X \geq 1)$

Go to your Poisson tables, and search for the $m=0.5$ column.
We are interested in the probability of \textbf{exactly} one vehicle sold on a particular day.
From the tables we can easily work out P($X \geq 1$), but this is probability of one or more vehicles being sold.
This is not the same thing.
\[P(X \geq 1) = P(X =1) + P( X=2) + P(X=3) + \ldots
P(X \geq 1) = P(X=1) + P(X \geq 2)\]
From tables
$P(X \geq 1)$
$P(X \geq 2)$

Six day working week?
our unit period is now six days.
How many vehicles do we expect to sell in 6 days?
answer = 3
$m=3$
