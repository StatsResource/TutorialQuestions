\subsection*{Question 1}
You develop a random number generater which assigns a value to the random variable $X$ according to the following probability distribution:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|ccccc|}
	\hline
&&&&&\\[-0.4cm]
$x$ & 0.0 & 0.5 & 1.0 & 2.0 & 3.0 \\
\hline
&&&&&\\[-0.4cm]
$\Pr(X=x)$ & $0.4$ & $0.2$ & $0.15$ & $0.15$ & $?$ \\[0.1cm]
\hline
\multicolumn{6}{c}{}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

{\bf(a)} What is value the value of $\Pr(X = 3.0)$? 
 \item  Calculate $E(X)$ and $Sd(X)$. 
 \item  You produce a gambling game where the player wins (in euro) the value of $X$ generated, e.g., if a $2.0$ appears, \euro{2} is won. How much should you charge for a play of this game so that that \emph{you} (the programmer) make a profit of \euro{0.10} on average per game? (i.e., the player \emph{loses} \euro{0.10} on average) 
 \item  Using your answer to part (c), determine the probability that you make a profit when somebody plays this game. 
 \item  If 10 people play this game, what is the probability that you make a profit 8 times?

\subsection*{Question 2}
You flip three coins. Let $X = $ ``the number of heads'' and $Y = $ ``the number of unique faces''.\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} What is the sample space for this experiment? 
 \item  Construct the \emph{joint distribution} for $X$ and $Y$. 
 \item  Based on this joint distribution, construct the \emph{marginal} distribution for $X$ and for $Y$. 
 \item  Are $X$ and $Y$ independent? 
 \item  Calculate $E(Y)$ and $Sd(Y)$. 
 \item  Calculate $\Pr(Y=2\,|\,X=2)$ and interpret its value (compare with $\Pr(Y=2)$).
