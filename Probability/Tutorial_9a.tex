Assume that the number of weekly study hours for students at a certain university
is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 22 and a standard deviation
of 6.
\begin{itemize}
\item Find the probability that a randomly chosen student studies less than 12
hours.
\item Estimate the percentage of students that study more than 37 hours.
\end{itemize}

In an examination the scores of students who attend schools of type A are
normally distributed about a mean of 55 with a standard deviation of 6. The
scores of students who attend type B schools are normally distributed about a
mean of 60 with a standard deviation of 5.
Which type of school would have a higher proportion of students with marks above 70?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Summarize the data in the above table using a frequency table. Use 6 class intervals, with 140 as the lower limit of the first interval.
\item Draw a histogram for the above data.
\item Comment on the shape of the histogram. Based on the shape of the histogram, what is the best measure of centrality and variability?
\item Construct a box plot for the above data. Clearly demonstrate how all of the necessary values were computed.
