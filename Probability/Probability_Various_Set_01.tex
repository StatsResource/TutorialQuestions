\item A coin is tossed 100 times. Using the appropriate approximating distribution, estimate the probability that
	a) exactly 46 heads are thrown
	b) between 48 and 59 heads (inclusively) are thrown.
\item	I obtain a hand of 13 cards. Calculate the probability of
	i) obtaining 2 aces.
	ii) obtaining 2 aces and 2 kings.
	iii) obtaining 2 aces or 2 kings.
	
\item A computer chooses a number at random n times from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (with replacement). Let S denote the sum of the numbers chosen. Show that
	E(S) = 3n and Var(S) = 2n.
	
\item	Let Y=aX+b. Prove that i) E(Y)=aE(X)+b, ii) Var(Y)=a2Var(X).
	
\item	a) Suppose X has a geometric distribution with parameter p. From the standard interpretation of the geometric distribution, conditioning on whether X=1 or not and using the memoryless property of the geometric distribution
	i)	calculate E(X)
	ii)	calculate Var(X). [Hint: first calculate E(X2)].
	
\item	The probabilities with which Liverpool win, draw or lose a premier league match are 0.5, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. Calculate the probability that in 8 matches
	i)	Liverpool lose 2 matches.
	ii)	Liverpool win 5 matches and draw 2.
\item % \frametitle{Review Question 5 :  Probability}
If A and B are events such that $P(A|B^c) = 2P(A|B)$ and $P(B^c) = 2P(B)$.
(The event $B^c$ is the complement of event B.) Compute the probability: $P(B^c|A)$ 
\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
\item Complement events: $P(B^c) = 1 - P(B)$. Also we are told $P(B^c) = 1-P(B)= 2P(B)$
\item Necessarily $1 = 3P(B)$. Therefore $P(B) = 1/3$ and  $P(B^c)=2/3$
\item Total Probability: $P(A) = P(A \mbox{ and } B) + P(A \mbox{ and } B^c)$
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}

\item I pick 3 cards from a pack of 52. Calculate the probability that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item I pick exactly one spade
\item I pick at least one spade
\item I pick exactly one spade, given that I pick at least one spade.
\end{enumerate}
