\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  \textbf{\textit{Probability (6 Marks)}}\\
An electronics assembly subcontractor receives its entire supply of resistors from two suppliers. Company A provides 70\% of the subcontractor's resistors, while company B supplies the remainder. The additional information has also been made available:

\begin{itemize}
\item[{$\bullet$}] 2\% of the resistors provided by company A failed the final test;
\item[{$\bullet$}] 3\% of company B's resistors also fail the final test.
\end{itemize}
\noindent Answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)](3 Marks) What is the probability that a resistor fails the final test?
\item[(ii)](3 Marks)  What is the probability that a resistor fails the final test given that the resistor in question came from company A?
%\item[iii.](2 marks) What is the probability that a resistor that fails final test was supplied by company A?
\end{itemize}
