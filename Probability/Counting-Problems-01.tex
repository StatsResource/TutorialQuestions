\item In the British national lottery 6 numbers are chosen without replacement from 49. Calculate the probability of 
i)winning the jackpot (choosing all 6 numbers correctly)
ii)winning the smallest prize (choosing 3 of the 6 numbers correctly)
iii)choosing at least one of the numbers correctly.

\itemI obtain a hand of 13 cards. Calculate the probability of
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item obtaining 2 aces.
\item obtaining 2 aces and 2 kings.
\item obtaining 2 aces or 2 kings.
\end{enumerate}






\subsection*{Question 1 Part A}

\noindent \textbf{Useful:} Binomial Probability Tree 
\begin{itemize}
\item All possible Outcomes:
$\{ (HHH), (HHT), (HTH), (HTT) , (THH), (THT), (TTH),(TTT)\} $



\item ``More Heads than Tails" means 2 or 3 Heads. Sample space from above written in terms of numbers f Heads: $\{ (3), (2), (2), (1), (2),(1),(1),(0)\} $

\[ \Pr(\mbox{More Heads than Tails} = \Pr(\mbox{2 Heads}) + \Pr(\mbox{3 Heads}) = 3/8 + 1/8 \]

\item $ \Pr(\mbox{2 Heads}) = 3/8 $

\end{itemize}
