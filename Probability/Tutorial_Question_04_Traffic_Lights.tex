c) Calculate the probability of obtaining exactly 2 sixes when I roll a die 5 times.
(4 marks)

\noindent \textbf{Worked Example}\\
A worker-operated machine produces a defective item with probability 0.01 if the worker follows the machineâ€™s operating instructions exactly, and with probability 0.04 if he does not. If the worker follows the instructions 90\% of the time, what is the probability that an item produced by the machine, selected at random, will be defective?

\item Based on the following information, express $q$ in terms of $p$ and $r$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose that 4 numbers have a mean of $p$
\item Suppose that five other numbers have a mean of $q$.
\item These nine numbers have a mean of $r$.

\item Probability of departing at correct time
\[P(C) = 107/170\]
\item Probability of being delayed and flying outside europe 
\[P(D  \mbox{ and } O) = 12/170\]
