A doctor treating a patient issues a prescription for antibiotics and provides for two repeat prescriptions. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The probability that the infection will be cleared by the first prescription is $p_1$ =0.6.
\item The probability that successive treatments are successful, given that previous prescriptions were not successful are $p_2$ = 0.5, $p_3$ = 0.4.
\end{itemize} Calculate the probability that:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item a patient will require the third prescription,
\item the patient is still infected after the third prescription,
\item the patient is cured by the third prescription, given that the patient is eventually cured.
\end{enumerate}





\end{enumerate}
