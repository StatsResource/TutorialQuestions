\subsection*{Question 6}

Let's assume that a sequence of bits (binary numbers) is transmitted and, at the other end, decoded; the decoder has a 10\% chance reading a bit incorrectly (i.e., reading a 0 as 1 or vice versa). Let $X$ be the number of errors in the sequence received (i.e., the decoded sequence). Calculate the probability that there are: \\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} \emph{No} errors in a 20-bit string. 
{\bf(b)} Less than three errors in a 10-bit string. 
{\bf(c)} More than 10 errors in (i) a 50-bit string and (ii) a 100-bit string (hint: use tables). 
{\bf(d)} Calculate the average number of errors in a 100-bit string. Calculate the standard deviation also.
