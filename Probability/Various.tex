99% Confidence Interval


Degrees of freedom ()
Degrees of freedom depends on the sample size (n).

Sample size (n)

If the sample size is less than or equal to 30, it is considered a small sample.(= n-1)
If the sample size is larger than 30, it is considered a large sample.(=)

Significance ()

Number of tails (k)

Hypothesis tests can either be one tailed or two tailed.
Confidence intervals are always two tailed procedures.

Normal distribution
Normal distributions are a family of distributions that have the same general shape. They are symmetric with scores more concentrated in the middle than in the tails. Normal distributions are sometimes described as bell shaped. 

Examples of normal distributions are shown below. Notice that they differ in how spread out they are. The area under each curve is the same. The height of a normal distribution can be specified mathematically in terms of two parameters: the mean(μ) and the standard deviation (σ).

What is the probability that two people have the same birthday?
For the sake of simplicity, exclude leap years.
Outcomes =\{ (Jan 1, Jan 1, Jan 1), ( Jan 1, Jan 1, Jan 2), \ldots , (Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31) \}
Number of outcomes = (365)^3.
