\item For a random sample of 10 light bulbs for a particular brand, the mean bulb life is 4,000 hr with a sample
standard deviation of 200 hours. For another brand of bulbs, a random sample of 8 has a sample mean lifetime of 4,300 hours and a sample
standard deviation of 250 hours.\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)]Test the hypothesis that there is no difference between the mean operating life of the two brands of bulbs,
using the 5 percent level of significance.
