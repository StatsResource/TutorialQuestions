\item Two injection moulding machines in separate plants manufacture battery
connectors for the same client company.  The critical parameter is the mean cushion distance.  A random sample of 4 products from each company was tested and the results recorded as follows:

Factory 1Factory 2
Sample (mm) Measurements38,     38.5
39.5,  40(35.5)  (36.5)
(37)     39
Mean cushion distance3937
Standard DeviationUnknownUnknown

You are required to test the hypothesis that there is no statistical difference between the two populations.  You may assume a 10% probability of a Type 1 error.

\item The sample variance for population one is 0.83 and sample variance for population two is 2.17.  Does the data provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the populations are homogenous.  Use a 5% level of significance and indicate clearly all calculations made.

\item A production manager wanted to establish if there was a relationship between the number of hours recorded for a manufacturing cell and the number of units produced in the cell.  A random sample of 7 different times and their corresponding number of units produced were recorded as follows:
