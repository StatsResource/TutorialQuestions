2.	A die is rolled until a number divisible by 3 is obtained. Calculate the probability that
i)	the die is rolled exactly once.
ii)	the die is rolled exactly five times.
iii)	the number of rolls is even.


3.	A die is thrown 720 times.
a)	What is the distribution of the number of sixes obtained?

b) Using an appropriate approximation, estimate the probability that
i) exactly 120 sixes are obtained.
ii) between 115 and 127 (inclusively) sixes are obtained.
