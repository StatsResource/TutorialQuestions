\subsection*{Information Theory }
A source language has 5 symbols A, B, C, D and E. The associated
probabilities of these symbols are given in the table below:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
% after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
Symbol & Probability \\ \hline
A & 0.60 \\
B & 0.30 \\
C & 0.05 \\
D & 0.03 \\
E & 0.02 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] Calculate the entropy of the source language.
\item[b.] Define a Huffman binary code for the source language.
\item[c.] Calculate the efficiency of the code in (b) above.
\item[d.] Calculate the redundancy of the code in (b) above.
\item[e.] Briefly state what is meant by the Prefix Condition.
\end{itemize}
