%% Repeat 2005 (question 2)(b)	
The compressive strength of concrete for fresh-water exhibition tanks has mean 5000 psi and standard deviation 240 psi. Assuming that the compressive strength is normally distributed, calculate the probability that the compressive strength of a sample of concrete is less than 4900 psi.

Question 1(a)

Upper Limit ;  $U = \mu + 3 \sigma $
Lower Limit ;  $L = \mu - 3 \sigma $

Standardisation
Apply the standardisation formula	$Z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} $	to both limits

\[ Z_U = \frac{U-\mu}{\sigma} =  \frac{(\mu + 3 \sigma)-\mu}{\sigma} = 3\]
