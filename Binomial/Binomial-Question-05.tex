\subsubsection{Question 3.6}

A dice is thrown 5 times. Calculate the probability of

i.
Obtaining exactly one six


ii)    Obtaining at least one six
bi.
Calculate the (theoretical) mean and variance of the number of sixes obtained?



P(x=k)=nkpk(1-p)n-k






Part 1 


P(x=1)=51(16)1(56)4


\[ \choose{5,1}= \frac{5!1!}{4!}= 5\]


P(x=1)= 5(16)1(56)4= 0.401 


%================================================================================%


Part 2


obtaining at least one head is complement of obtaining zero heads


P(x1)= 1 - p(x=0)



P(x=0)=50(16)0(56)5


50=5!0!5!= 1


P(x1)= 1- 0.401 =0.599
